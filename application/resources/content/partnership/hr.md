We are organizers of largest free software engineering courses in Eastern
Europe, meetups and schools to build community around education and have
endless source of hiring. Enterprise-level development requires strong
fundamental knowledge and high engineering culture based on CS: we propagate
GRASP, SOLID and GoF, DDD, IoC, DI, TDD, rule of three, Law of Demeter,
Fail-fast, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Secure by design, Agile, SSOT, etc.

Create/improve a team proposition for partners:

- Find right experts and developers
- Hiring, interviewing, onboarding and reformatting
- Knowledge transfer
- Educational programs and access to the community

## Access to the community

Our partners have access to top professionals. We can quickly hire seniors and
leads who suit the position in the team and can become a key person in
development process.

We can build big teams (50-500 developers) in a few weeks/months because our
database contains over 20k middle devs with relevant JS and Node.js competences.

We will help with interviewing candidates, onboarding, reformatting teams,
skills audit, add missing expertise.
