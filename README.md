## Concept

Sphere Digital Platform is a distributed software infrastructure with highly adaptable and scalable services, capable of handling complex data and process tasks in a wide variety of applied fields. Sphere is a comprehensive solution that works with databases, provides and access APIs, generates reports, and runs domain logic (business processes). It has autogenerated general-purpose and multiple custom UIs (user interfaces with tables, forms, charts, and other visual elements). Sphere supports different clients (web, mobile, desktop) and provides integration with third-party information systems over various protocols (by contract basis and dynamic binding using introspection and scaffolding). Sphere can change data entities dynamically to be adaptive in a quickly changing world (flexible and capable of changing the data model and behavior without the need for deep code rewrites). Sphere is intended to deal with large databases and complex processes; it can provide automated integration with various other information systems using different protocols and provide facilities for custom integrations. Sphere provides collaborative tools for corporate users and online communities. The codebase and knowledge base of the Sphere project are community-driven, free, open-source, and knowledge-oriented. We support a holistic data-centric approach to create transparent and secure global integration hubs, reliable data processing, and data bridges between business entities and individuals in real-time.

Sphere can be applied as a core free technology for constructing the future in multiple fields: retail and supply, government, healthcare, automotive, banking, energy, insurance, education, agriculture, real estate, pharmaceuticals, tourism, e-commerce, media & entertainment, etc. Sphere is not ERP, CRM and so on itself but it can provide services for data analytics, resource planning, integrations for the following software classes (can transparently handle data and processes) as a platform for: ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), SCM (Supply Chain Management), FM (Financial Management), CRM (Customer Relationship Management), HRM (Human Resources Management), BI (Business Intelligence), MRP (Material Requirements Planning), EAM (Enterprise Asset Management), BPM (Business Process Management), CPM (Corporate Performance Management), CMS (Content Management System), WMS (Warehouse Management System).

Everyone knows that the development of any corporate and government information system begins with creating the architecture of the system as a whole, creating subsystems and repositories for its modules, establishing the code structure in each repository. This is complex and expensive process, it usually takes from 1 to 3 months of initial work of the team to prepare logging, database drivers, reports generation, executing batch jobs and scheduling, attach queueing system and mail delivery, notifications for client apps, automated backups, deployment, testing and monitoring infrastructure, data validation tools, caching, balancing, security, etc. there are a lot of subsystems and modules and all of them do not relate to the subject domain. All mentioned work is ballast for the project, it includes selection of dependencies (libraries) and needed technologies, probation, adaptation and integration of components. It is common way for developers to create their own system-level solutions (not related to the domain) to cover mentioned areas. Such solutions become part of the information system and increase its cost of ownership. All in-house general purpose libraries requires maintenance and regular updates untill the end of life of host information system. In practice, they raise the cost of development for nothing, it is ballast. On the other hand, using external dependencies (libraries) involves risks; their creators are often do not guarantee any support and do not have long-term development plans. Also, dependencies are not designed as part of something complex and significant efforts are required to integration and binding them into one solution. So, in every large-scale information system, two products appear - the platform and the system itself. Often they are so intertwined that the platform cannot simply be reused or adapted to solve other problems, being simply redundant protection against dependency instability. The obvious way out of these two extremes is the creation of platforms as a separate class of systems, making it possible to separate all system tasks from product ones and make repeating infrastructure modules reusable. This approach allows you to optimize development costs, radically speed up it, eliminate repetitive identical tasks and ensure a higher level of their implementation.

It's widely acknowledged that that developing any corporate or government information system starts with creating its overall architecture, selecting technologies, establishing subsystems and modules repositories. This complex and costly process typically requires 1-3 months (depending on the project's scale) of initial team effort to prepare: logging, database drivers, report generation, scheduling, queueing systems and mail delivery, client notifications, automated backups, deployment, testing, monitoring infrastructure, data validation tools, caching, balancing, security, etc. Many subsystems and modules are involved, none of which relate directly to the domain. This groundwork, involving the selection of dependencies (libraries) and technologies, probation, adaptation, and integration of components, often becomes ballast for the project. Developers commonly create their own system-level solutions (not domain-related) to cover these areas, increasing the information system's ownership cost. All in-house general-purpose libraries require maintenance and updates until the end of the information system's life, unnecessarily raising development costs. Conversely, using external dependencies carries risks (their creators often do not guarantee support or have long-term development plans). Furthermore, integrating these dependencies into a cohesive solution demands significant effort.

Consequently, every large-scale information system splits into two products: the platform and the system itself, often so closely linked that the platform cannot be easily reused or adapted for other challenges, acting simply as redundant protection against dependency instability. The best solution to these issues is the creation of platforms as a separate category of systems. This strategy allows for the separation of system tasks from product tasks, making repetitive infrastructure modules reusable. Such an approach not only optimizes development costs and significantly speeds up the process but also removes redundant tasks and ensures a higher standard of implementation. Enhancing the platform's functionalities by 15-25% has the potential to exponentially increase the scope of product deployment, potentially by hundreds of times. Additionally, configuring module settings through declarative code and domain-code (low-code) enhances the reusability of software components. This approach also facilitates their seamless integration via standardized software interfaces, aimed to unify platform modules.
